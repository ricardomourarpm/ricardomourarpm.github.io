## Dear Professor Saleh,

I wanted to let you know how much you meant to me. Your wisdom and kindness made a big difference in my life. I'm Mina, one of your students.

Your guidance and warmth touched not only me but also many others. You believed in me when I didn't believe in myself, and that made all the difference. Your lessons weren't just about academics; they were about life.

Now that you're in heaven, I want to say thank you. You'll always be remembered, and your teachings will stay with me forever.

## üìö His Academic Legacy

Professor Saleh was not just my supervisor; he was a towering figure in the field of statistical inference. His groundbreaking work in:

### **Shrinkage Estimation Methods**
His development of preliminary test approaches to shrinkage estimation revolutionized how we think about parameter estimation in statistical models. His insights continue to influence my research today.

### **Penalized Regression Models** 
The techniques he pioneered in penalized regression have become fundamental tools in modern statistics, especially in high-dimensional data analysis.

### **Statistical Theory**
His contributions to statistical theory, particularly in the areas of estimation and hypothesis testing, have shaped generations of statisticians.


## üíù Personal Memories

### **His Wisdom Beyond Academia**
Professor Saleh taught me that:
- True knowledge comes from humility
- The best research serves humanity
- Success is measured not just by publications, but by the lives you touch
- Every setback is a setup for a comeback


## üåç His Global Impact

Professor Saleh's influence extended far beyond our university:

- **International Recognition**: His work was cited by researchers worldwide
- **Academic Collaboration**: He fostered partnerships across continents
- **Student Success**: His mentees now teach and research globally
- **Professional Service**: He served on editorial boards of major statistical journals

## üìñ Lessons That Live On

### **Research Philosophy**
From Professor Saleh, I learned:
1. **Question everything** - even established theories can be improved
2. **Collaborate generously** - the best research happens in community
3. **Communicate clearly** - complex ideas mean nothing if others can't understand them
4. **Stay curious** - the moment you stop learning is the moment you stop growing

### **Life Philosophy**
Beyond statistics, he taught me:
- **Integrity in all things** - your reputation is your most valuable asset
- **Kindness costs nothing** - but its value is immeasurable
- **Persistence pays off** - breakthrough moments come to those who don't give up
- **Give back** - use your knowledge to lift others up

## üèÜ Continuing His Legacy

In honor of Professor Saleh, I commit to:

### **In My Research**
- Advancing shrinkage estimation methods with the same rigor he demonstrated
- Applying his theoretical insights to practical problems
- Publishing work that would make him proud

### **In My Teaching**
- Mentoring students with the same patience and care he showed me
- Making complex concepts accessible, just as he did
- Inspiring the next generation of statisticians

### **In My Life**
- Living with the integrity and kindness he modeled
- Supporting colleagues and students as he supported me
- Honoring his memory through excellence and service

## üïäÔ∏è A Final Thank You

Professor Saleh, your impact on my life cannot be measured in papers published or degrees earned. You gave me confidence when I had none, direction when I was lost, and friendship when I needed it most.

Your work in statistical inference will continue to influence researchers for generations. But for me, your greatest contribution was showing me what it means to be not just a good statistician, but a good person.

You believed in me when I didn't believe in myself, and that made all the difference. Your lessons weren't just about academics; they were about life.

Thank you for everything, Professor. Your teachings will stay with me forever.

Rest in peace, knowing that your legacy lives on in every life you touched, every mind you opened, and every heart you encouraged.
