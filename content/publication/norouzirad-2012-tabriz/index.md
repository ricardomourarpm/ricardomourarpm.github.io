abstract: 'It is sometimes interesting to find an estimator of the underlying loss function as a measure of closeness. In this presentation, a general form of an unbiased estimator of the quadratic loss function which is polynomial in coordinated, is derived. It is worthwhile to point that the unbiased estimator of the loss is constructed according and the use of Stein-type shrinkage estimators which are almost biased.'
