abstract: 'In this paper, we consider the full rank multivariate regression model with matrix elliptically contoured distributed errors. We formulate a conjugate prior distribution for matrix elliptical models and derive the posterior distributions of mean and scale matrices. In the sequel, some characteristics of regression matrix parameters are also proposed.'
