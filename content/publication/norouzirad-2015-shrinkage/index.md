abstract: 'Following least absolute and shrinkage selection operator (LASSO), we define preliminarily, Stein-type shrinkage and its positive part LASSO estimators and propose an algorithm to derive them using the result of [James et al. (2012)](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-Constrained-Lasso-James-Paulson/d01879fd336ca22556681a313acdbbc7a3be6afd).'
