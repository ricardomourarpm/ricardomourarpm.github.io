abstract: 'The objective of this article is to create a Neutrosophic Generalized Exponential (NGE) distribution in the presence of uncertainty. It is possible to calculate the mean, variance, moments, and reliability expression of the NGE distribution. With the help of graphs, the nature of the distribution and the reliability and hazard functions are studied. To determine the NGE distributionâ€™s parameters, a maximum likelihood estimation technique is used. The performance of estimated parameters is further tested using simulations. Finally, an actual data set is examined to show how the NGE distribution works. According to a model validity test, the NGE distribution is superior to the existing neutrosophic distributions that can be found in the literature.'
