abstract: 'Piracy has been a global concern and a threat to the safety of people performing maritime trade around the globe. Since ancient times maritime piracy has been a common practice that, unfortunately, has not ended in the current days. A georeferenced dataset providing the position, meteorologic conditions, and a description of the occurrence can provide essential information for analyzing this global phenomenon. The dataset focuses on the Gulf of Guinea (GoG) as an area dominated by corruption and weak supervision capacity by the local authorities. The time interval considered in this paper is between 2010 and 2021. Using this simple dataset, it is possible to analyze attributes such as when the piracy occurred or if the illegal activity involved deaths or kidnapping. The accuracy of the data was guaranteed by cross-referencing data sources, so we have 595 pirate attacks accurately described. This dataset can easily be used for data mining, allowing further analysis of the patterns and trends of pirate attacks in the GoG over time.'
