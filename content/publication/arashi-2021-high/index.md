abstract: 'The ridge regression estimator is a commonly used procedure to deal with multicollinear data. This paper proposes an estimation procedure for high-dimensional multicollinear data that can be alternatively used. This usage gives a continuous estimate, including the ridge estimator as a particular case. We study its asymptotic performance for the growing dimension, i.e., $ p \to \infity$ when $n$ is fixed. Under some mild regularity conditions, we prove the proposed estimatorâ€™s consistency and derive its asymptotic properties. Some Monte Carlo simulation experiments are executed in their performance, and the implementation is considered to analyze a high-dimensional genetic dataset.'
