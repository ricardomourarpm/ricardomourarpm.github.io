abstract: 'Likelihood-based exact inference procedures are derived for the multivariate regression model, for singly and multiply imputed synthetic data generated via Posterior Predictive Sampling (PPS), via a newly proposed sampling method, which will be called Fixed-Posterior Predictive Sampling (FPPS), and via Plug-in sampling. By contemplating the single imputation case, the new developed procedures fill the gap in the existing literature where inferential methods are only available for multiple imputation and, by being based in exact distributions, it may even be applied to cases where the sample size is small. Simulation studies compare the results obtained from all the proposed exact inferential procedures and also compare these with the results obtained from the adaptation of Reiterâ€™s combination rule to multiply imputed synthetic datasets. An application using U.S. 2000 Current Population Survey data is discussed and measures of privacy are presented and compared among all methods.'
