abstract: 'Unmanned vehicles have become increasingly popular in the underwater domain in the last decade, as they provide better operation reliability by minimizing human involvement in most tasks. Perception of the environment is crucial for safety and other tasks, such as guidance and trajectory control, mainly when operating underwater. Mine detection is one of the riskiest operations since it involves systems that can easily damage vehicles and endanger human lives if manned. Automating mine detection from side-scan sonar images enhances safety while reducing false negatives. The collected dataset contains 1170 real sonar images taken between 2010 and 2021 using a Teledyne Marine Gavia Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV), which includes enough information to classify its content objects as NOn-Mine-like BOttom Objects (NOMBO) and MIne-Like COntacts (MILCO). The dataset is annotated and can be quickly deployed for object detection, classification, or image segmentation tasks. Collecting a dataset of this type requires a significant amount of time and cost, which increases its rarity and relevance to research and industrial development.'
